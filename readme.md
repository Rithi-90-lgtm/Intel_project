Develop a deep learning model using Bidirectional LSTM to classify Yelp reviews as either positive (1) or negative (0) based on their text content. The model should preprocess raw text, convert it into numerical sequences, and predict sentiment with high accuracy.

2.The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is represented by four features: Sepal Length Sepal Width Petal Length Petal Width. i)To develop a machine learning model using the Decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. ii)To develop a machine learning model using the K th cluster algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. iii)To develop a machine learning model using the Random forest algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

OUTPUT: i) Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.00 Prediction for new sample: virginica ii)Predicted Cluster: 0 Prediction for new sample: setosa iii)Random Forest Model Accuracy: 1.00 Prediction for new sample: virginica
